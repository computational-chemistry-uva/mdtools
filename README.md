# About
The mdtools package contains a collection of different tools that I created and used while working on molecular simulations. They are grouped into different submodules, each with their own function. Each submodule can be used separately. The package is not finished, but relatively easily extendable. Please contact me if you want information on the code structure, want to contribute or have any other question.
